# Working with csv, json, xml files

## Using the CSV or pandas library in Python, you can read, analyze, and do things with CSV files.

## JSON is a format with a dictionary structure. The json library can also be used to read and work with json files

## Working with data in XML format is a little different than working with data types. You can also use the XML library to work with XML

## In general, CSV and JSON take over because they can be used directly.
